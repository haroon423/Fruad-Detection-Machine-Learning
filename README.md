## Introduction

Fraud detection is critical in various domains such as finance, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. This project uses machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing historical data. The goal is to train models that can classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates new features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implements various machine learning algorithms including:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of model performance and feature importance.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
